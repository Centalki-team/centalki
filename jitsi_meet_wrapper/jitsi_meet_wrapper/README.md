# jitsi_meet_wrapper

Jitsi Meet Plugin for Flutter.<br>
Wrapping JitsiMeetSDK for
[Android](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/dev-guide/dev-guide-android-sdk) and
[iOS](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/dev-guide/dev-guide-ios-sdk).

This wrapper got built for [Appella](https://www.appella.app/) App. The goal is to keep it generic, however at the
moment, it only contains features needed in Appella. I am happy to review PRs that add additional functionality to this
plugin, however it is not guaranteed that I will have time to develop and add features that are not needed in
Appella.<br>
Nevertheless, please always create an issue and I will try to have a look.

### Join a meeting

To join a meeting, you have to create meeting options and then launch the meeting:

```dart
var options = JitsiMeetingOptions(roomName: "my-room");
await JitsiMeetWrapper.joinMeeting(options);
```

Take a look
at [`JitsiMeetingOptions`](https://github.com/saibotma/jitsi_meet_wrapper/blob/main/jitsi_meet_wrapper_platform_interface/lib/jitsi_meeting_options.dart)
for all the available options.

## Configuration

Most recommendations below are based on the official documentation of JitsiMeetSDK
for [iOS](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/dev-guide/dev-guide-ios-sdk)
It is recommended to take a look at them, if you have any issues or need more detailed information.

<a name="ios"></a>

### iOS

#### Podfile

The platform (and also the deployment target) needs to be set to `12.0` or newer and bitcode needs to be disabled.<br>
The file should look similar to below:

```
platform :ios, '12.0'

post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      config.build_settings['ENABLE_BITCODE'] = 'NO'
    end
  end
end
```

#### Info.plist

Add `NSCameraUsageDescription` and `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` to your `Info.plist`.<br>
In order for your app to properly work in the background, select the `audio` and `voip` background modes.<br>
Additionally, it is recommended to set `UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance` to `NO`.<br>

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) needs access to the camera for meetings.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) needs access to the microphone for meetings.</string>
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
	<string>audio</string>
	<string>voip</string>
</array>
<key>UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance</key>
<false/>
```

#### Screen sharing

To enable screen sharing on iOS, you have to add a "Broadcast Upload Extension" to YOUR app. That's why we can't add it
to the plugin by default. Don't be afraid of implementing this, it is actually very easy.

The steps presented below are a summary of the very detailed explanation in
the [official docs](https://github.com/jitsi/handbook/blob/75d38b5a3db9d44ff60feb7c72dd6f7d4a5ea83c/docs/dev-guide/ios-sdk.md#screen-sharing-integration)
. They are tested to work with this version of the plugin.

- Add another target of the type "Broadcast Upload Extension" (BT) as shown in the
  screenshot. ![screenshot 1](https://github.com/jitsi/handbook/blob/c105fe0782e272875b36dd763fa54f19dd91c9a7/docs/assets/iOS_screensharing_1.png)
- Copy the files from `jitsi_meet_wrapper/example/ios/Broadcast Extension/` into the folder of your newly created BT.
- Set the deployment target of BT to 14 or above.
- Create an app group for BT and the "Runner" target (RT) and add both targets to this app group.
- Replace `appGroupIdentifier` in `SampleHandler.swift` with your app group name.
- Add the key value pairs `RTCAppGroupIdentifier` with the name of your app group and `RTCScreenSharingExtension` with
  the bundle identifier of BT to `Info.plist` of RT.
- Don't forget to enable the feature flag `FeatureFlag.isIosScreensharingEnabled` when joining the meeting in Dart code.
- Make sure that `voip` is set as `UIBackgroundModes` in `Info.plist` of RT.

Most of the above steps have already been executed on the example app in this repository. However, the app group was not
created yet, as this requires a development team to be set. You can execute some simple steps in to make screen sharing
work on the example app:

- Add a development team.
- Create an app group with the name `group.dev.saibotma.jitsi-meet-wrapper-example.appgroup`.
- Add the app group to both the "Runner" and the "Broadcast Extension" target.
- Add the feature flag `FeatureFlag.isIosScreensharingEnabled: true` in `_joinMeeting` in `main.dart` of the example
  app.
- Run the app...

Screen sharing is available for applications running on iOS 14 or newer. The deployment target of your app ("Runner"
target) may be lower, though. Those devices will just not be able to share their screen.

### Android

#### AndroidManifest.xml

JitsiMeetSDKs AndroidManifest.xml will conflict with your project, namely the `android:label` field. To counter that, go
into
`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the tools library and `tools:replace="android:label"` to the
application tag.

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
          xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools" <!-- Add this -->
          package="your.package.name">
    <application tools:replace="android:label" <!-- Add this -->
                 android:name="your.app.name"
                 android:label="your app name"
                 android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
                 ...
    </application>
    ...
</manifest>
```

#### build.gradle

Update your minimum SDK version to `23` in `android/app/build.gradle`.

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 23 // Change this
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

If you still want to compile your app for a SDK version lower than 23, you can add the following line to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
          xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
          package="dev.saibotma.jitsi_meet_wrapper_example">

    <!-- Add this -->
    <uses-sdk tools:overrideLibrary="dev.saibotma.jitsi_meet_wrapper, org.jitsi.meet.sdk, co.apptailor.googlesignin, com.calendarevents, com.reactnativecommunity.asyncstorage, com.reactnativecommunity.netinfo, com.rnimmersive, com.corbt.keepawake, com.BV.LinearGradient, com.horcrux.svg, com.oney.WebRTCModule, com.ocetnik.timer, com.kevinresol.react_native_default_preference, com.learnium.RNDeviceInfo, com.amplitude.reactnative, com.reactnativegooglesignin, com.reactnativecommunity.clipboard, com.swmansion.gesturehandler.react, org.linusu, org.reactnative.maskedview, com.reactnativepagerview, com.oblador.performance, com.swmansion.reanimated, com.th3rdwave.safeareacontext, com.swmansion.rnscreens, com.reactnativecommunity.slider, org.devio.rn.splashscreen, com.brentvatne.react, com.reactnativecommunity.webview"/>

    <application tools:replace="android:label"
```

We will try to keep this list of overridden libraries up-to-date. In case it does not work, please feel free to create an issue or see [this](https://github.com/saibotma/jitsi_meet_wrapper/pull/32#discussion_r867651938) comment for how to generate an updated list of overridden libraries.

Keep in mind that when you call methods of this package with an unsupported SDK version, your app could crash. So you should check the SDK version of the device before calling any Jitsi methods. If a user has an unsupported SDK version, you could show a dialog that the Jitsi feature is not support for this device. This has the advantage that these users can still use other features of the app which don't require that minimum SDK version.

#### ProGuard

You might have to add some ProGuard rules if your app crashes when using this package. Follow the
instructions [here](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/dev-guide/dev-guide-android-sdk/#proguard-rules).

## Listening to Meeting Events

Take a look
at [`jitsi_meeting_listener.dart`](https://github.com/saibotma/jitsi_meet_wrapper/blob/main/jitsi_meet_wrapper_platform_interface/lib/jitsi_meeting_listener.dart)
for information about supported events and their documentation.

Feels free to create a PR if one is missing. It is fairly straightforward to implement them.

### Per Meeting Events

To listen to meeting events per meeting, pass in a `JitsiMeetingListener`
to `joinMeeting`. The listener will automatically be removed when the conference is over
(which is not `onConferenceTerminated`).

```dart
await JitsiMeetWrapper.joinMeeting(
  options: options,
  listener: JitsiMeetingListener(
    onConferenceWillJoin: (url) => print("onConferenceWillJoin: url: $url"),
    onConferenceJoined: (url) => print("onConferenceJoined: url: $url"),
    onConferenceTerminated: (url, error) => print("onConferenceTerminated: url: $url, error: $error"),
  ),
);
```
